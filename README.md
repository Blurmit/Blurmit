### Hey there! I'm Blurmit ðŸ˜„

I'm a Java developer. I mainly create Minecraft plugins. I'm also helping develop a programming language called [JPizza](https://github.com/Lemon-Chad/JPizza)

**Current Projects:**
* I'm currently working on a Minecraft plugin called Basics. It's goal aims to be something similar to EssentialsX, but with a lot more useful features/commands along with staying fairly lightweight.

**Recommended Projects:**
* If you're looking for a fun plugin to mess around with friends recommend MeteorShower.
* SimpleVanish is also another useful plugin. Its goal was to be a much lighter-weight vanish plugin for servers with limited resources.

That's all, have a great day!
